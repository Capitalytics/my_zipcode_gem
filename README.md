# My Zipcode Gem

[![MIT-LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/midwire/my_zipcode_gem.svg)](https://github.com/midwire/my_zipcode_gem/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE)

Simple gem to handle zipcode lookups and related functionality.  `rake zipcodes:update` will automatically download and update your local zipcode database.  Generates three models for extended zipcode functionality.

## Versions

* 0.1.x is for Rails versions less than 4.x
* 0.2.x is for Rails 4 and above

## Installation

Add the following line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'my_zipcode_gem'

Run:

    rake bundle install

Generate the models and populate the data:

```
rails g my_zipcode_gem:models
rake db:migrate
rake zipcodes:update
```

You should now have three new tables and three new models, Zipcode, State, County.

## Usage

```
zipcode = Zipcode.find_by_code '66206'
zipcode.state.abbr    # => 'KS'
zipcode.city          # => 'Shawnee Mission'
zipcode.county.name   # => 'Johnson'
zipcode.lat.to_s      # => '38.959356', it is actually a BigDecimal object converted to_s for documentation.
zipcode.lon.to_s      # => '-94.716155', ditto
zipcode.is_geocoded?  # => true, most if not all should be pre-geocoded.
```

You can also look for a zipcode from a city and state:

    Zipcode.find_by_city_state "Shawnee Mission", "KS"

You can use State and County objects as follows:

```
state = State.find_by_abbr "MO"
state.cities.count    # => 963
state.cities          # gives you a sorted array of all cities for the state
state.zipcodes.count  # => 1195
...
county = state.counties.first
county.cities.count   # => 5
county.cities         # gives you a sorted array of all cities for the county
county.zipcodes.count # => 5
```

### Automatic JQuery/AJAX lookup

You can have a user enter a zipcode and automatically lookup their city, state and county.

Put something like this in your view:

```
f.text_field :zip, :size => 5, :maxlength => 5, :class => 'zipcode_interactive'
f.text_field :city, :size => 20, :maxlength => 60, :readonly => true
f.text_field(:state, :size => 2, :maxlength => 2, :readonly => true)
f.text_field(:county, :size => 20, :maxlength => 60, :readonly => true)
```

Then add this to your application.js, but remember to replace `mycontrollername` with your own controller.

    $(document).ready(function() {
      // Interactive Zipcodes
      $('input.zipcode_interactive').blur(function(data) {
        var elem_id = $(this).attr("id");
        var base_id = elem_id.substring(0, elem_id.lastIndexOf("_"));
        $.get("/mycontrollername/get_zip_data/" + this.value, {},
        function(data) {
          var zipcode = $.parseJSON(data);
          var city = $('#' + base_id + '_city');
          var state = $('#' + base_id + '_state');
          var county = $('#' + base_id + '_county');
          if (zipcode.err) {
            alert(zipcode.err);
          } else {
            city.val(zipcode.city);
            state.val(zipcode.state)
            county.val(zipcode.county)
          }
        })
      });
    });

You will also need a controller method similar to this, which will return the data to your form:

    def get_zip_data
      @zipcode = Zipcode.find_by_code(params[:code], :include => [:county, :state])
      if @zipcode
        @counties = County.find(:all, :conditions => [ "state_id = ?", @zipcode.county.state_id ])
        data = {
          'state' => @zipcode.state.abbr,
          'county' => @zipcode.county.name,
          'city' => @zipcode.city.titleize
        }
        render :text => data.to_json
      else
        if params[:code].blank?
          return true
        else
          if params[:code].is_zipcode?
            data = {
              'err' => "Could not find Zipcode [#{params[:code]}].  If this is a valid zipcode please notify support <support@mydomain.com>, so we can update our database."
            }
          else
            data = {
              'err' => "[#{params[:code]}] is not a valid Zipcode."
            }
          end
          render :text => data.to_json
        end
      end
    end

And define a route for the AJAX function in routes.rb:

    get 'mycontrollername/get_zip_data/:code', :controller => 'mycontrollername', :action => 'get_zip_data'

That's about it.
